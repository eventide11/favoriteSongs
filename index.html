			<p>Two jumps in a week</p>
			<p>I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy?</p>
			<p>Flying on your motorcycle</p>
			<p>Watching all the ground beneath you drop</p><br>
			<p>You'd kill yourself for recognition</p>
			<p>Kill yourself to never, ever stop</p>
			<p>You broke another mirror</p>
			<p>You're turning into something you are not</p><br>
			<p>Don't leave me high</p>
			<p>Don't leave me dry</p>
			<p>Don't leave me high</p>
			<p>Don't leave me dry</p><br>
			<p>Drying up in conversation</p>
			<p>You will be the one who cannot talk</p>
			<p>All your insides fall to pieces</p>
			<p>You just sit there wishing you could still make love</p><br>
			<p>They're the ones who'll hate you</p>
			<p>When you think you've got the world all sussed out</p>
			<p>They're the ones who'll spit at you</p>
			<p>You will be the one screaming out</p><br>
			<p>Don't leave me high</p>
			<p>Don't leave me dry</p>
			<p>Don't leave me high</p>
			<p>Don't leave me dry</p><br>
			<p>Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had</p>
			<p>The best thing that you've ever, ever had</p>
			<p>It's the best thing that you've ever had</p>
			<p>The best thing you have had is gone away</p><br>
			<p>So don't leave me high</p>
			<p>Don't leave me dry</p>
			<p>Don't leave me high</p>
			<p>Don't leave me dry</p>
			<p>Don't leave me high</p>
			<p>Don't leave me high</p>
			<p>Don't leave me dry</p>

			<p>Watching the video that you sent me</p>
			<p>The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping</p>
			<p>You know that I'm obsessed with your body</p>
			<p>But it's the way you smile that does it for me</p>
			<p>It's so sweet, knowing that you love me</p>
			<p>Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet</p>
			<p>Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair</p>
			<p>It's so sweet</p>
			<p>Watching the video where you're lying</p>
			<p>In your red lingerie ten times nightly</p>
			<p>You know I think your skin's the perfect color</p>
			<p>But it's always your eyes that pull me under</p>
			<p>It's so sweet, knowing that you love me</p>
			<p>Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet</p>
			<p>Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair</p>
			<p>It's so sweet</p>
			<p>And I will gladly break it</p>
			<p>I will gladly break my heart for you</p>
			<p>And I will gladly break it</p>
			<p>I will gladly break my heart for you</p>
			<p>And I will gladly break it</p>
			<p>I will gladly break my heart for you</p>
			<p>And I will gladly break it</p>
			<p>I will gladly break my heart for you</p>
			<p>It's so sweet, knowing that you love me</p>
			<p>Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet</p>
			<p>Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair</p>
			<p>It's so sweet</p>

			<p>I see myself in you</p>
			<p>In everything you do</p>
			<p>And when you’re all alone at night</p>
			<p>You know I am by your side</p>
			<p>'Cause I’m there too</p><br>
			<p>I see me in your eyes</p>

			<p>And I’m dying from a broken heart</p>
			<p>I’m there too</p><br>
			<p>I see your footsteps in the sand</p>
			<p>As you journey on across this land</p>
			<p>But if you should fall on your way</p>
			<p>Then I will carry you that day</p>
			<p>'Cause I’m there</p>
			<p>I’m there too</p>

			<p>I see your face in mine</p>
